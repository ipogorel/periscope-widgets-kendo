This library is part of the [Periscope] platform and contains Datatables.net grid implementation


## Running The App

To run the app, follow these steps.

1. Ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) is installed. This provides the platform on which the build tooling runs.
2. From the project folder, execute the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install
  ```
3. Ensure that [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install -g gulp
  ```
4. Ensure that [jspm](http://jspm.io/) is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install -g jspm
  ```
  > **Note:** jspm queries GitHub to install semver packages, but GitHub has a rate limit on anonymous API requests. It is advised that you configure jspm with your GitHub credentials in order to avoid problems. You can do this by executing `jspm registry config github` and following the prompts.
5. Install the client-side dependencies with jspm:

  ```shell
  jspm install -y
  ```
  >**Note:** Windows users, if you experience an error of "unknown command unzip" you can solve this problem by doing `npm install -g unzip` and then re-running `jspm install`.


6. To build the code, you can now run:

	```shell
	gulp build
	```
7. You will find the compiled code in the `dist` folder, available in three module formats: AMD, CommonJS and ES6.

8. See `gulpfile.js` for other tasks related to generating the docs and linting.
